Compare and contrast Flexbox and CSS grid, how are they alike and how are they
different?

Flexbox and CSS Grid are both powerful tools for creating modern web layouts, but they have different uses. 
Flexbox is great for one-dimensional layouts, like aligning items in a row or column, and is ideal for components 
like navbars or aligning elements on a single axis. CSS Grid, on the other hand, is designed for two-dimensional 
layouts, allowing precise control over both rows and columns, making it perfect for complex page layouts.
While Flexbox is easier to use for simpler designs and has better support in older browsers, CSS Grid is more 
powerful for intricate layouts but can be more complex to implement. Both can be used togetherâ€”Flexbox for 
individual components and CSS Grid for overall page structure. Ultimately, choosing between the two depends 
on the specific needs of the project.
