1. The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies how browsers should create a representation
of an HTML page and how JavaScript can manipulate and modify the contents of a
web page while it is in the browser window.
2. If a malicious user adds code to an input that is eventually generated as html, that code
could potentially be run for different users, this is an example of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
3. HTML events are actions that happen to HTML elements.
4. Event listener sets up a function that will be called whenever the specified event is delivered
to the target.
5. jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to
accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.
6. The val() function grabs the value of inputs in jQuery.
