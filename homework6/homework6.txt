PHP is a server-side scripting language used to create dynamic web pages by 
processing logic on the server and then sending the resulting HTML to the client.
Server-side languages (like PHP, Python, Node.js) handle tasks such as database 
interactions, form processing, and content rendering on the server before sending 
it to the client.

2.
Alike:
Both can manipulate HTML.
Both can be embedded into HTML files.
Differences:
PHP runs on the server (server-side), while JavaScript runs on the client 
(client-side).
PHP can handle databases and file systems directly, while JavaScript often 
uses APIs for similar operations.

3.
Simplicity: PHP is relatively easy to learn and is beginner-friendly.
Large community support: It has a large ecosystem and many resources.
Integration: PHP integrates well with HTML and databases like MySQL.
